## SlideAware: Integrating global landslide and weather data for hazard insight
The goal of this project is to build a data pipeline to integrate global landslide and weather information into one database with an interactive web platform for data query and visualization.

### Introduction
Landslides are the most widespread geological hazard and can occur anywhere in the world [[link](https://www.who.int/health-topics/landslides#tab=tab_1)]. In the US, for example, there were over 3000 landslide incidents in the past 10 years, costing property and life losses. Despite the significant impact of this natural disaster on society, few information is easily found and accessible for the general public and no centralized dataset is available in the government level.
